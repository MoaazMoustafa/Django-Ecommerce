# Django-Ecommerce
A full Ecommerce website built with Python and Django framework 
I create this project following [Very_academy](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOLrQ9Pn6caxY4Q1U9RjO1bulQp5NDYS_) Ecommerce Tutorial Series
which I recommend to anyone who wants to dig deep into Django. It covers a lot of topics from beginner to advanced ones. I have learned a lot from it 
- Dealing with sessions
- Testing every part of your project such as models, views, URLs, ...etc
